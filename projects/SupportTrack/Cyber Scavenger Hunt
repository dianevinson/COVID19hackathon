Hackathon pitch template
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Due to the cancelation of many summer camps that would've enriched the students' knowledge of cybersecurity, we're trying to offer an online option to teach middle school students basic cybersecurity concepts.
DELIVERABLE: We're looking to make a web based application where students will solve cybersecurity puzzles via a scavenger hunt to save UD from destruction!
SKILLS NEEDED: web dev, writer for story line, anyone with knowledge of cybersecurity to help create simple puzzles, people with knowledge of ciphers
